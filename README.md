# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard allows users to search for a city. After entering a city and clicking the search button, the user is sent to a results page populated with the current weather conditions for the chosen city and a five day forecast for the city. If the user searches for another city, the previously searched for city is added to their search history.
